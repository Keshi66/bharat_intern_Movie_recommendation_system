# Recommendation Algorithms:
Collaborative Filtering (User-based or Item-based): Recommends movies based on the ratings of similar users or items.
Content-based Filtering: Recommends movies similar in genre, director, actors, or other attributes to user-rated movies.
Hybrid Approach (Optional): Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for more comprehensive recommendations.
# Data Preprocessing:
Handles missing values, outliers, and data cleaning to ensure model quality.
Feature engineering may be applied to create additional informative features from the data.
# Evaluation:
Employs standard metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess model performance.
Provides clear visualizations of results to aid in model evaluation and improvement.
# Scalability:
Considers strategies like dimensionality reduction or distributed computing to scale the system for larger datasets (if applicable).
